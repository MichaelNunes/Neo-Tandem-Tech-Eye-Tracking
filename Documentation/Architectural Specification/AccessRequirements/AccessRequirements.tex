\subsubsection{Human Access Channel}
    The program will be accessible by human users via a desktop machine or a laptop that has and that can support the eye tracking equipment which requires a USB 3.0 (or higher) port for data transfer. The program is designed for and will only run any Windows operating system from Windows 7 onward.
    
\subsubsection{System Access Channel}
    The System will be supported by any and all systems that support USB 3.0 (or higher) as well as run any Windows platform onward. The system also requires the machine to contain Dot Net Framework 4.0 or higher to ensure program compatibility and efficiency. Another requirement will be that of internet access for the Eye Tribe recording server which requires it.
    
\subsubsection{Integration Channel}
The program will use a file system that stores all the eye tracking data in separate files. The files that are stored will then be used in the program to carry out functions such as making heat and gaze-point maps and giving result data to the user.
