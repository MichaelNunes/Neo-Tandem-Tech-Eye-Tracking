\subsection{Render 3D scene}
    \textbf{Important}\newline
    Given a 3D scene, in a format such as a blend file or an obj file, the scene must be able to be rendered on a display. The rendered scene will be placed in a window for viewing so that the eye-tracker can "see" the scene.
\subsection{Eye-track on a 3D scene}
    \textbf{Important}\newline
    The eye-tracking software must be used or augmented in such a way that specific areas in the 3D scene can capture viewing information. This is will be done given information from the eye-tracker itself.
\subsection{Create heat-mapped texture}
    \textbf{Important}\newline
    From the eye-tracking information a heat map in the form of a texture map must be produced.
\subsection{Map heat-mapped texture back onto scene}
    \textbf{Important}\newline
    The heat-mapped texture of the object must be able to be mapped correctly back onto the scene, that is the placement must be as was the original texture.
\subsection{Dual texture mapping}
    \textbf{Nice-to-have}\newline
    Both the original and the heat-mapped texture are visible in the scene at the same time.
