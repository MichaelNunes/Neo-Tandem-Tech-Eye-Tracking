\subsection{Project Background}
The Geo-Information Science (GIS) department of the University of Pretoria (UP) wanted a system that could track the attention of a user on a 3D model. The system needs to provide a way to measure the amount time a user has looked at a specific point.\\
As an added, they also wanted to be able to track the attention of a user on a video, also providing the same manner of measurement used for 3D models.\\
The GIS has provided the team with an Eye-Tribe camera. The Eye Tribe also provides a Software Development Kit (SDK) for development using their camera.\\

\subsection{Project Vision}
The aim of this project is to provide a Windows form application that incorporates the Eye-Tribe (SDK). The application would would use the Eye-Tribe camera to track the focus of a user on 3D models. Using the SDK, it would generate a heat-map of the users focus that can be applied to the 3D model and videos. Heat-maps would also be possible to render to the video.
