\subsection{Project Background}
The Geo-Information Science (GIS) department of the University of Pretoria (UP) wanted a system that could track the attention of a user on a 3D model. The system needs to provide a way to measure the amount time a user has looked at a specific point. As an added, they also wanted to be able to track the attention of a user on a video, also providing the same manner of measurement used for 3D models.\\
\\
The GIS department has provided the team with The Eye Tribe eye tracking camera. The Eye Tribe also provides a Software Development Kit (SDK) for development when purchasing their camera. The camera comes as a much cheaper solution than most other eye tracking solutions such as Tobii. The camera we were provided with is currently the cheapest on the market and sells for only \$99. The camera has an accuracy rating of, on average, about 75\% but can achieve accuracy ratings of much higher if all perfect conditions are met. \\

\subsection{Project Vision}
The aim of this project is to provide a Windows form application that incorporates The Eye-Tribe (SDK). The application would use the Eye-Tribe camera to track the focus of a user on various types of  models. Using the SDK, it would generate a heat-map of the users focus and eye movements that can be applied to the various 2D, 3D and video models.
