\subsection{Project Background}
The Open Gaze And Mouse Analyzer is a company involved with the development of of eye tracking technology. This technology allows users to interact with a device compatible with the OGAMA software. This also provides another means of communication by providing hands-free communication with the device the user is using.
    OGAMA uses an eye-tracking device designed and created by The Eye Tribe. This device connects to a user's computer through a USB 3.0 connection. The device tracks the users eye movements through a series of sensors within the front of the device.

\subsection{Project Vision}
The aim of this project is to provide an extension to the already existing functionality of the OGAMA software. The extension should be able to track the focus of a user on 3D models. It should be able to generate a heat-map of the users focus that can be applied to the 3D model. An extra functionality should be that the extension can track the focus on a video. Heat-maps should also be possible to render to the video.
