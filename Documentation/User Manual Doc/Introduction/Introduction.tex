\subsection{Scope and Purpose}
The purpose of this eye-tracking software is to extend the capabilities of OGAMA.OGAMA is an open-source eye-tracking software that was created to track the movement of the eye on slideshows study designs.The extension of this media to others would greatly benefit most parties as it will be able to be used to track gaze movements not only on slideshows but also on 3D models and Video.
\subsection{Process Overview }
There are a few core process that have been implemented and that will allow for more effective eye-tracking across mediums.The process are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Eye tracking on 3D models and videos.
\item Creation of heat maps from eye-tracking.
\item Saving heat map on specific media.
\item Creating Statistics on information gathered.
\end{itemize}
The following process listed are the core of this program as they carry out the basic functionality of this software.Below an in depth description is given about each process.
