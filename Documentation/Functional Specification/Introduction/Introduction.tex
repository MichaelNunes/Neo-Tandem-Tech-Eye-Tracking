\subsection{Project Background}
The Geo-information science (GIS) department requires a program that will be able to track the eye movements of a user on different types of media. These include 3D models, videos and images. The information needs to be stored as heatmaps that will show where most of the attention is being paid. The application uses an eye-tracking device designed and created by The Eye Tribe. This device connects to a user's computer through a USB 3.0 connection. The device tracks the users eye movements through a series of sensors within the front of the device. This will help the GIS in there future projects.

\subsection{Project Vision}
The aim of this project is to provide an extension to the already existing functionality of the Eye Tribe SDK. The program should be able to track the focus of a user on 3D models. It should be able to generate a heat-map of the users focus that can be applied to the 3D model. An extra functionality should be that the program can track the focus on a video. Heat-maps should also be possible to render to the video.
