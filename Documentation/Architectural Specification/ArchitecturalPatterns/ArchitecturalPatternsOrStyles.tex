The project can easily be split as: User, Interface and, Background Calculations. The user interacts with the Interface, the program that will be executed, handling the eye tracking.

It is with this in mind that the Model-View Controller (MVC) design pattern will be used.
The MVC separates the data model, UI, and control logic which is exactly what we want. We want the user to be able to use our system without having to know how it works. Only the basics should be available i.e record, printing out texture/model.
