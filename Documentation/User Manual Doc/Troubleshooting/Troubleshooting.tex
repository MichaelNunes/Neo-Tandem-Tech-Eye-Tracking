This section of the user manual is dedicated to showing the errors that can occur on the system.This will also provide possible solutions to problems that you may encounter. Please note that the currently the program is not finished and the accompanying user manual is also not yet complete. This will be updated as the system is developed.\\

The system is split into many subsections. This section will also be split to ensure you are able to file what you need.

\subsection{Start screen}
\subsubsection{String is not a path}
This error occurs when starting a new recording project and the path in the path text-box does not follow path structure. The program will not continue if this error occurs.
This can be fixed by ensuring that the text inside is a actual path such as: C:/User/MyPath.
\subsubsection{The path does not exist}
The following error occurs when the path that is selected no longer exists on the computer. This can be fixed by doing on of two things:\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ensuring that the path specified is correct.
\item Creating the file path to match the selection. 
\end{enumerate}
Any one of these solutions can help fix the problem and allow the program to continue.
\subsection{Calibration screen}
\subsubsection{Could not find EyetribeWinUI.exe}
The program requires that the Eye-tribe software be installed on the system.This error occurs when the software is not found on the system.\\
The solution is simply to install the software which can be found on The Eye-Tribe website when you have purchased the camera.
\subsection{Recording set-up screen}
\subsubsection{Name has invalid characters}
This error occurs when the name for the recording contains invalid characters.These characters need to be alphanumeric and can not contain any symbols.//
The solution is to simply use only alphanumeric numbers and not symbols.
\subsection{General recording errors}
\subsubsection{Could not find [insert path and name].txt}
When a recording has been completed and this error is shown it means that the file that stores the data was never created so it can not create heat maps for the specific media type.This error can occur due to multiple factors.\\
\begin{itemize}
\item The eye tracking camera was not connected or was not calibrated correctly.
\item The eye tracking camera was connected to a USB 2 port.
\end{itemize}
The solution would simply be to check that The Eye-tribe is connected to the computer properly and also that it is connected to a USB 3 port.
