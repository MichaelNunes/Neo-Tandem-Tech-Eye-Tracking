The application will be coded in C\# and thus we will be using the relevant architectures and frameworks to create this application.

\subsubsection{.Net Framework version 4}
\begin{flushleft}
	This framework was developed by Microsoft and is an integral part in C\# development, as it forms the basis of the language and its capabilities.
\end{flushleft}

\subsubsection{NUnit}
\begin{flushleft}
This is a unit testing framework developed for all .Net languages, and in turn takes advantage of a lot of the languages capabilities.
\end{flushleft}

\subsubsection{NInject}
\begin{flushleft}
\end{flushleft}

\subsubsection{Eye Tribe SDK}
\begin{flushleft}
This forms the basis of our application as this provides the ability to record and interpret where the user is looking and feed real time information that can then be used to build heatmaps and statistics.
\end{flushleft}

\subsubsection{HeatMap.NET}
\begin{flushleft}
This provides the functionality to build heatmaps based on information that is fed to the module.
