\subsection{Human Access Channel}
    The program will be accessible by human users via a computer(either a desk top or a laptop) that has and that can support the eye tracking equipment. The Eye Tribe eye tracking equipment will only function with a desktop computer or a laptop that supports USB 3.0 or better technology. The program will only run on a Windows operating system.
\subsection{System Access Channel}
    The only systems that are supported by this program are desktops and laptops that have support for USB 3.0 or better. These computers must be running a Microsoft Windows operating system from Windows XP or higher. Framework .NET 4.0 or higher is needed to run the program efficiently.
\subsection{Integration Channel}
The program will use a file system that stores all of the eye tracking data in separate files.The files that are stored will then be used in the program to carry out functions such as making heatmaps and giving result data to the user.This is how the program is integrated with the system and how it will be integrated with the system.
