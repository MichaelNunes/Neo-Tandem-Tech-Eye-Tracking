\subsection{Description of Document}
This document aims to show the designs used to implemented the software that is being created known as eye tracking.The document is divided into three sections.Each section describes a certain aspect about the design of the software and how the structure and the interface is combined to create the final product.
The purpose of this eye-tracking software is to allow the user to track eyes and the movement of eyes on different kinds of media and models.This is something that has not been done yet and will be a great contribution to the eye tracking.The eye tracking will be performed on 2D,3D and video models.
\subsection{Section Overview }
The three sections that are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Data Design.
\item Interface Design.
\item Procedural Design.
\end{itemize}
These three sections each cover a very important part of design of a software application.Data design will talk mainly about the structures in place within the program and how all the data structures are linked and communicate.Interface design will describe the choices made for the look of the software while still incorporating the UX goals of the user to make the program easier to use.Procedural Design will focus on the producers that are carried out in the program.\\
You may note that Architectural Design is not included in this document.This is not necessary as the topics that would be covered by that section have been covered in great detail in the architectural requirements document found here:
