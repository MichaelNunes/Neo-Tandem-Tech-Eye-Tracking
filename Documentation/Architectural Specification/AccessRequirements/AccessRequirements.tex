\subsubsection{Access channel requirements}
\textbf{Desktop or Laptop}
\newline
The primary focus of this project is to extend the functionality of the already existing OGAMA application. As such a laptop or desktop computer with a USB 3.0 port is required to run the OGAMA application and Eye Tribe technology on.
\newline
\textbf{Mobile Connection}
\newline
 This functionality is prioritized as nice to have, but none the less has to be taken into account. To allow for mobile connection it is again necessary to have a network enabled laptop or desktop computer i.e. Wi-Fi enabled. This functionality would then allow for the mobile use of the OGAMA application and its extensions.\newline
