\subsection{Render 3D scene}
    \textbf{Priority: Critical}\newline
    Given a 3D scene, in a format such as a blend file or an obj file, the scene must be able to be rendered to a display. The rendered scene will be placed in a window for viewing so that the eye-tracker can "see" the scene.\newline
    \textbf{Pre-condition: }
    Open the 3D rendering software software with the 3D scene file.\newline
    \textbf{Post-condition: }
    Have a window open that has the scene loaded and rendered.
    
\subsection{Eye-tracking on a 3D scene}
    \textbf{Priority: Critical}\newline
    The eye-tracking software must be used or augmented in such a way that specific areas in the 3D scene can capture viewing information. This is will be done given information from the eye-tracker itself.\newline
    \textbf{Pre-condition: }
    Have OGAMA and eye-tracking equipment setup and running.\newline
    \textbf{Post-condition: }
    Captured information into a file.
\subsection{Create heat-mapped texture}
    \textbf{Priority: Critical}\newline
    From the eye-tracking information a heat map in the form of a texture map must be produced. The format of the texture will depend on the 3D software used.\newline
    \textbf{Pre-condition: }
    Have captured information from OGAMA and eye-tracking equipment.\newline
    \textbf{Post-condition: }
    Captured information made into a heat map image.
\subsection{Map heat-mapped texture back onto scene}
    \textbf{Priority: Critical}\newline
    The heat-mapped texture of the object must be able to be mapped correctly back onto the scene, that is the placement must be as was the original texture.\newline
    \textbf{Pre-condition: }
    Have heat-mapped texture..\newline
    \textbf{Post-condition: }
    3D scene now has new heat-mapped texture applied.
\subsection{Real-time heat-mapping}
    \textbf{Priority: Nice-to-have}\newline
    As the scene is being viewed it will also be coloured according to the eye-trackers information.\newline
    \textbf{Pre-condition: }
    Have OGAMA and eye-tracking equipment setup and running.\newline
    \textbf{Post-condition: }
    Captured information used to colour the scene.
\subsection{Interactive Maps}
Description: This function involves overlaying a map with data captured by the Eye tribe eye tracking technology and stored using the OGAMA freeware. The data will be retrieved from a database which has already been integrated into the OGAMA freeware that will be used for this project. Through the use of the analytical features provided by OGAMA, its functionality will be extended into the visualization of the information it has stored. This includes the attention maps, scan paths and replay functions.
Priority: Important
Preconditions: Have the Eye tribe eye tracking technology running during the activity.     
Post Conditions: Output a 2D representation on the interactive map with the necessary data overlaying it.
