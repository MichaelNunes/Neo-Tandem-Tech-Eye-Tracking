\subsection{Human Access Channel}
    The program will be accessible by human users via a desktop machine or a laptop that has and that can support the eye tracking equipment which requires a USB 3.0 (or higher) port for data transfer. The program is designed for and will only run any Windows operating system from Windows 7 onwards.
    
\subsection{System Access Channel}
    The only systems that are supported by this program are desktops and laptops that have support for USB 3.0 or better. These computers must be running a Microsoft Windows operating system from Windows 7 or higher. Framework .NET 4.0 or higher is needed to run the program efficiently.
    
\subsection{Integration Channel}
The program will use a file system that stores all of the eye tracking data in separate files.The files that are stored will then be used in the program to carry out functions such as making heatmaps and giving result data to the user.This is how the program is integrated with the system and how it will be integrated with the system.
