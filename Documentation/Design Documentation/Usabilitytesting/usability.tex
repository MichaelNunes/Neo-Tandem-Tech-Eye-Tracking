Usability testing of a program is crucial as people need to experience the project.These people need to be people that havent used the system at all or know anything about the system.

\subsection{Date of testing}
Usability testing of the program took place between 5th of October to the 9th of October.This was during the holdidays and we set up a space to perform the tests.

\subsection{The participants}
The participants used in the testing were largely students from different departments within the university. Each participant was asked to use the program to perform various types of recordings on all the types of models available. The feedback from each participant included their opinion on the following: accuracy of recordings, guided nature of the process, layout of the forms, preview window, size and style of font, size and style of buttons, loading times and calibration.

\subsection{The feedback}
The feedback taken from the users were gathered and then analysed.The following was the results of the feedback.

\subsubsection{Calibration}
The calibration was considered easy to perform and the window that displays the position of the eyes was helpful in positioning the user for optimal use of the program.

\subsubsection{Accuracy of recordings}
The heat-maps and gaze-plots have a high enough accuracy that most participants agreed with the results.There were a couple of inconsistencies between the gaze-plot and the heat map.

\subsubsection{Layout of the forms}
The forms were thought to be very simple and clean. Initially (with the first group of participants) the layouts were considered very cluttered.

\subsubsection{Guided nature of the process}
This helped most of those who were lost at first although the limitation was apparent on advanced users.

\subsubsection{Preview window}
This window was useful in verifying the right model was being used.

\subsubsection{Size and style of font}
The style was bland but the size was readable.

\subsubsection{Size and style of buttons}
The buttons were a little to small so participants had a hard time pressing them.

\subsubsection{Loading times}
Most of the participants agreed that the loading times were too long with any video processing and the 3D rendering.

\subsubsection{Way forward}
Since the usability testing concluded great effort has gone into improving upon the style of the font and buttons as well as the loading times of all the models.
